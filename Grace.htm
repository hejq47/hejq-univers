<p class="lyric" align="center"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="5">As we gather 
in the chapel here in old Kilmainham Jail<br>
I think about these past few weeks, oh will they say we've failed?<br>
From our school days they have told us we must yearn for liberty<br>
Yet all I want in this dark place is to have you here with me</font></span></p>
<p class="lyric" align="center"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="5">Oh Grace just 
hold me in your arms and let this moment linger<br>
They'll take me out at dawn and I will die<br>
With all my love I place this wedding ring upon your finger<br>
There won't be time to share our love for we must say goodbye</font></span></p>
<p class="lyric" align="center"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="5">Now I know 
it's hard for you my love to ever understand<br>
The love I bare for these brave men, the love for my dear land<br>
But when Pádraic called me to his side down in the GPO<br>
I had to leave my own sick bed, to him I had to go</font></span></p>
<p class="lyric" align="center"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="5">Oh, Grace just 
hold me in your arms and let this moment linger<br>
They'll take me out at dawn and I will die<br>
With all my love I'll place this wedding ring upon your finger<br>
There won't be time to share our love for we must say goodbye</font></span></p>
<p class="lyric" align="center"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="5">Now as the 
dawn is breaking, my heart is breaking too<br>
On this May morn as I walk out, my thoughts will be of you<br>
And I'll write some words upon the wall so everyone will know<br>
I loved so much that I could see his blood upon the rose.</font></span></p>
<p class="lyric" align="center"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="5">Oh, Grace just 
hold me in your arms and let this moment linger<br>
They'll take me out at dawn and I will die<br>
With all my love I'll place this wedding ring upon your finger<br>
There won't be time to share our love for we must say goodbye<br>
There won't be time to share our love for we must say goodbye</font></span></p>
