We ve known each other since we<br>
Were nine or ten<br>
Together we ve climbed hills and trees<br>
Learned of love and abc s<br>
Skinned our hearts and<br>
Skinned our knees<br>
<br>
Goodbye my friend it s hard to die<br>
When all the birds are singing<br>
In the sky<br>
Now that spring is in the air<br>
Pretty girls are everywhere<br>
Think of me and I ll be there<br>
<br>
We had joy we had fun we had<br>
Seasons in the sun<br>
But the hills that we climbed were<br>
Just seasons out of time<br>
<br>
Goodbye papa please pray for me<br>
I was the black sheep of the family<br>
You tried to teach me right from wrong<br>
Too much wine and too much song<br>
Wonder how I got along<br>
<br>
Goodbye papa it s hard to die<br>
When all the birds are singing in the sky<br>
Now that the spring is in the air<br>
Little children everywhere<br>
When you see them I ll be there<br>
<br>
We had joy we had fun we had<br>
Seasons in the sun<br>
But the wine and the songs like the<br>
Seasons have all gone<br>
We had joy we had fun we had<br>
Seasons in the sun<br>
But the wine and the song like<br>
The seasons have all gone<br>
<br>
Goodbye Michelle my little one<br>
You gave me love and helped<br>
Me find the sun<br>
And every time that I was down<br>
You would always come around<br>
And get my feet back on<br>
The ground<br>
<br>
Goodbye Michelle it s hard to die<br>
When all the birds are singing in<br>
The sky<br>
Now that the spring is in the air<br>
With the flowers everywhere<br>
I wish that we could both be there<br>
<br>
We had joy we had fun we had<br>
Seasons in the sun<br>
But the hills that we climbed were<br>
Just seasons out of time<br>
<br>
We had joy we had fun we had<br>
Seasons in the sun<br>
But the wine and the song like the<br>
Seasons have all gone<br>
<br>
We had joy we had fun we had<br>
Seasons in the sun<br>
But the wine and the song like the<br>
Seasons have all gone<br>
<br>
We had joy we had fun we had<br>
Seasons in the sun<br>
But the wine and the song like the<br>
Seasons have all gone</font></font></p>
